### Edits/Commits Below

    - Observation of lion done.
    - Framework for the battle against the Nemean Lion mostly done but Lion/stats still needs to be created.  Need unique attacks for him, too.
    - Added safeguard against negative damage dealt
    - Added defense functions, made armor and armor values live
    - First encounter is working fine.  Pummel/Tackle is functioning correctly.  Added the beginning for the next part of chapter one.  Tested, did some fine tuning.  Added level up/heal for after encounter.
    - I changed how I wanted the HTML and CSS to work and function entirely.  Yay for brains that work best as you're about to fall asleep.  
    - Set up CSS and HTML files
    - Changed from Hercules to the more traditional Heracles before I got too far!
    - Made a simple flow chart on .io for Chapter One
    - Downloaded images and sorted things into files for better ease of use.  
    - Began chapter One: The Nemean Lion
