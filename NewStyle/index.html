                <p>Welcome!  Many have heard the feats of Hercules and many have scribed the feats in various ways.  I'm here to tell you today that you MAY not have heard it right.  We're going to adventure through some of the 12 Labours that Hercules endured for his cousin, King Eurystheus.</p>

                <p>Heracles had a cousin, Eurystheus, the king of Tiryns.  Some rumors say that Eurystheus imposed 12 Labours onto Heracles to atone for sins, but other rumors say it was familial rivalry.  No one knows for sure.</p>
                <p>You, reader, are going to help Heracles overcome some of those trials!</p>
                <p>The first trial that Eurystheus gave to Heracles was to defeat the Nemean Lion.  The Nemean lion is said to have impenetrable fur...</p>
                <p>You, as Heracles, set out to find a way to defeat the legendary Nemean Lion.</p>

                <p>While out seeking answers as to where the Nemean Lion is or how you may defeat it, you encounter a group of people.  Only two of them look ready to fight but they look ragged, as if they have been on the road in poor conditions.  You know that it's overcast, muddy, and allover not pleasant so it doesn't take one long to look this way.  On the other hand, if they've been out jumping peasants for a while, they would be equally unkempt.  </p>
                <p>Will you attack the members of the group that seem ready to fight or will you attempt to talk to them?  Only one of the men is armed, the other just looks the tough sort.</p>
                <p>Attacks currently available to Heracles are jab and tackle.  You may also attempt to pummel your opponent if they're pinned.</p>

                <p>You feel invigorated from your fight.  The Gods smile upon you and renew your vigor for the coming challenges.</p>
                <p>You went north to where the rag tag group of people came from.  There indeed used to be a village here.  And indeed, you see signs of a massive lion who has prowled the premise.  It only takes a few moments of investigating before you easily spot the lion in the distance.  Are you ready to fight or do you wish to observe?</p>
