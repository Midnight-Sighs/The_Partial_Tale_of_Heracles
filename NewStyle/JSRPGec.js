// You are Hercules, the greatest of the Greek Heroes! You have been tasked by King Eurystheus to slay the vicious Nemean Lion, defeat the impossible nine-headed Lernaean Hydra, and capture the guard dog of the underworld—Cerberus.

// Features:  
// As a developer, I want to make at least five commits with descriptive messages. 
// As a user, I want an engaging story to be told using alerts. 
// XXX As a user, I want Hercules (and each enemy), to have health, attack power, and an array of attack names saved in an object literal.
// XXX As a user, I want the ability to select Hercules’ attack using a menu prompt.
// XXX As a user, I want the foe’s attack to be chosen at random.
// As a user, I want the results of each attack to be logged in the console. 
// As a developer, I want to use an Attack() function that will terminate when Hercules or an enemy’s health reaches zero. 
// As a developer, I want my RunGame() function to call my other functions in a logical order that will determine game flow.
// As a developer, I want all of my functions to have a Single Responsibility. Remember, each function should do just one thing!
