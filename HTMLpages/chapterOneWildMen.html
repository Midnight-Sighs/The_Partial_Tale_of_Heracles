        <p>While out seeking answers as to where the Nemean Lion is or how you may defeat them, you encounter a group of people.  Only two of them look armed but they look ragged, as if they have been on the road in poor conditions.  You know that it's overcast, muddy, and allover not pleasant so it doesn't take one long to look this way.  </p>
        <p>Will you attack the armed members of the group or will you attempt to talk to them?</p>
        <p>Attacks currently available to Heracles are punch and tackle.  You may also attempt to pummel your opponent if they're pinned.</p>
